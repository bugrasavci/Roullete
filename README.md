## **Known Issues or Future Improvements**

- **Resume Feature (Optional):**
  - The game does not currently support resuming from the last saved state upon reopening. This feature is planned for future development.

- **Zero/Double-Zero Option (Optional):**
  - The American Roulette (with double-zero) and European Roulette (with single-zero) selection feature is not yet implemented. The game currently defaults to a single-zero roulette wheel.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Engine:** Unity (2022.3.x)
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Version Control:** Git
- **UI Framework:** Unityâ€™s built-in UI system (No third-party plugins like DoTween were used)

## **Future Plans**

1. Implement the **Resume** feature to allow players to continue from their last saved state.
2. Add support for **American Roulette** with double-zero and a toggle option to choose between European and American rules.
3. Improve UI/UX for smoother transitions and better feedback during gameplay.
4. Optimize the spinning wheel animations for even smoother transitions.
